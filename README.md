# Python2-Programs
This is just a random collections of codes that I wrote while learning Python 2.
Some are really small and not quite intellectually challenging.

But if you go through them you will get a rough idea of what the code does and
the logic I used while making them.

P.S. Some of the programs are the answers to coding questions on Hackerearth ;)
